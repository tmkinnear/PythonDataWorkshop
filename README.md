# PythonDataWorkshop
Python Data Analysis Workshop

All content for the Python Data Analysis Workshop centered on the University of Kent BEACON observatory weather station data. Written by Dr T M Kinnear for the purpose of the SEPNet GradNet training event for new PGRs.

The main document is Python_Data_Handling_Workshop.pdf. Weather_all.zip contains a .csv formetted data file for all of the 2015-2022 weather data. There are two sets of .ipynb notebooks, one based around using only Numpy, and one using Pandas. Each of these has an additional file with the same name but .html extension which provides a readable copy of the notebooks without using Jupyter.
